            <h1>How Mangroves Slow Coastal Erosion</h1>
            <div class="author">
                <p>By Raj Saha, PhD</p>
            </div>
            <p>Bangladesh is losing ground. Every year, river erosion swallows up 10,000 hectares of land, 
                displacing thousands. The country's vast river delta, home to 170 million people, sits barely 
                above sea level, making it one of the world's most climate-vulnerable regions.
            </p>
            <p>
                To illustrate the impact of coastal erosion in Bangladesh's river delta, we present time-lapse 
                imagery comparing two distinct locations over the past two decades: one safeguarded by mangrove 
                forests and another devoid of such natural defenses.

            <h2>Mangrove-Protected Regions</h2>
            <p>In areas like the Sundarbans, the world's largest contiguous mangrove forest, 
                mangroves play a crucial role in stabilizing coastlines. Their dense root systems 
                anchor the soil and dissipate wave energy, significantly reducing erosion. 
                Time-lapse imagery of these regions reveals minimal shoreline retreat compared to regions in the same
                river delta without mangroves.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="text-block">
            <h2>Unprotected Regions</h2>
            <p>Conversely, regions lacking mangrove coverage, such as parts of the Noakhali and Chittagong districts, 
                experience severe erosion. Although there is significant natural land loss and reshaping in the Ganges-Brahmaputra 
                river delta, human interventions, including deforestation and conversion to 
                shrimp farms, have exacerbated land loss. Time-lapse imagery of these areas shows dramatic changes in the coastline, 
                highlighting the vulnerability of unprotected shores. 
                
                These visual comparisons emphasize the critical importance of mangrove conservation and restoration 
                in mitigating coastal erosion and protecting vulnerable communities in Bangladesh.

            <p>This project uses time-lapse imagery from Google Earth Engine's Landsat 8 and Sentinel-2 satellite data. 
                The years span from 1984 to 2020.
